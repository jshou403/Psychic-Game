# Psychic-Game

[About]
    This is my first successful attempt at programming a simple guessing and matching game with Javascript. If this seems interesting to you, keep reading to learn a bit more about this project and where my skills are at this point in time (Oct 2019).

[Project-Goal]
    Create a game where: 
    - the user guesses the letter that is generated randomly
    - the user gets a 'win point' if the letters match
    - the user gets 8 more chances if the first guess doesn't match 
    - altogether, the user gets 9 guesses and if the user maxes out, they get a 'lose point'

[Bonus-Points]
    I used Bootstrap CSS for the second time! 

[Improvements]
    This game never really ends. It goes on as long as the user feels like playing. There could be a stopping point added at 10 losses or 10 wins, whichever comes first. 
    
    Maybe even a reset button or a start button before the game begins. 
    
    A space or alert to display the correct letter, if the user guesses it, would also make the game feel more whole.
